# Credit-calculator
This project is a Python application that allows you to compare credit parameters such as loan interest rate, loan length, and the impact of down payment value on installment amounts. It utilizes a class-based architecture, where each class corresponds to a specific method or functionality. The program communicates via the terminal (CLI), without a graphical user interface.
